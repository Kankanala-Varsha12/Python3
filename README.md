# Python3
# Grade Calculator (Python)

# Project Description
This project is a simple **Grade Calculator** written in Python.  
It takes marks as input from the user and calculates the grade using conditional statements.  
The program also validates input and handles invalid cases gracefully.


# Objectives
- Take marks input from the user
- Validate marks (0–100 range)
- Determine grade using 'if-elif-else'
- Use logical operators ('and', 'or')
- Apply nested conditions to simulate real-world rules
- Display meaningful messages for each grade
- Improve readability through refactored code

# Technologies Used
- Python 3

# File Structure
# How the Program Works
1. User enters marks (0–100)
2. Program checks for invalid input
3. Based on marks, grade is assigned:
   - A+ (90–100)
   - A (80–89)
   - B (70–79)
   - C (60–69)
   - D (40–59)
   - F (Below 40)
4. Appropriate message is displayed

# How to Run the Program
1. Open terminal / command prompt
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the command:
   '''bash
   python grade_calculator.py
